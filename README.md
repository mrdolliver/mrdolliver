## :pencil2:Technical Writing 

Here you can finsd examples of my technical wrting.
**How to Guides:** This is one example of a How to Guide that I wrote. 

**Authoring tools** Markdown/Visual Code Studio.

**Highlights** his guide was requested by sales engineers so that they could create a sandbox Kubernetes deployment in thier local labs for customer demos and employee technical  training. This guide was written in markdown so that it could be easily posted on an internal Confluence site. In addition the markdown was converted to PDF for portability.

**Participant Guides:** Each course came with a participate user guide to complement the ILT, VILT or self-paced courses. In addition, several product courses implemented hands on labs for learn by doing methodology.   
**Authoring tools :** MS Word/PDF  
**Highlights:** The participant user guides could be used to follow along with the presentation and make notes as well as future reference material. The hands-on lab guides were written as step by step, so that if there were different levels of knowledge in the training everyone could participate.

### Training Dept. Method of Procedure Documents. 
**Description:** As the department grew I created and maintained several Method of Procedure'(MOPs)'documents to include development work flow, how to for the Learning Management System instructor guides etc.  
**Technologies Used:** MS Word/PDF  
**Highlights:** The MOPS ensured that knowledge of the various procedures within the department were consistent and reproducible without relying on other persons.

# :mortar_board:Training Courses

### DOCSIS Primer 

**Description:** This is one of the very first projects I worked on at my previous company. The goal of the project was to begin creating bite size video tutorials on specific subjects, we named them video nibbles.

**Authoring tools:** MS PowerPoint, MS Word, Camtasia, Audacity.

**Highlights:** We had customers requesting these tutorials because it was not often possible to send all their personal to attend formal instructor led training. I developed dozens of these short tutorials on a wide variety of subjects this is just one example.

### Cloud Native & Kubernetes Primer

**Description:** A relatively short video to introduce customers both internal and external with no experience in cloud native technologies.  

**Authoring tools:** MS PowerPoint, MS Word, Camtasia, Audacity and AI voice over. 

**Highlights:** Both our customers and internal employees came from a cable and telco background. This course was meant to introduce them to the basic technologies and implementations in cloud native architectures. Additionally, it was meant to be a prerequisite for the 5G core product training.

### VCCAP Product Training


**Description:** The Virtual Converged Cable Access product was new product training. This product virtualized the the companies flagship product. 

**Technologies Used:** MS PowerPoint, MS Word,Camtasia and AI voiceover. 

**Highlights:**  In addition to the online version of the course, I built a network lab with 8 VCCAPs that could be accessed remotely from anywhere so the learners could participate in hands on labs and demos. In my previous experience this was a unique implementation in that when hands on labs were part of the course the equipment had to be shipped to the location. This was 1- Costly and 2- a logistical challenge.
