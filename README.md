[Participant guide sample](link-to-project) Each course came with a written participant guide that complemented the PowerPoint or online presentation(s)

**Hands on labs sample:** (link-to-project) Several product courses implemented a hands on lab component.


### DOCSIS Primer 

[DOCSIS Primer sample:](link-to-sample)

**Description:** This is one of the very first projects I worked on at my previous company. The goal of the project was to begin creating bite size video tutorials on specific subjects, we named them video nibbles.

**Authoring tools:** MS PowerPoint, MS Word, Camtasia, Audacity.

**Highlights:** We had customers requesting these tutorials because it was not often possible to send all their personal to attend formal instructor led training. I developed dozens of these short tutorials on a wide variety of subjects this is just one example.  
  

### [Cloud Native & Kubernetes Primer](link-to-project)
**Description:** A relatively short video to introduce customers both internal and external with no experience in cloud native technologies.  

**Authoring tools:** MS PowerPoint, MS Word, Camtasia, Audacity. For an example of the participant guide please click this link---->ICCAP Participant Guide. 

**Highlights:** Both our customers and internal employees came from a cable and telco background. This course was meant to introduce them to the basic technologies and implementations in cloud native architectures. Additionally, it was meant to be a prerequisite for the 5G core product training.    

### [ICCAP Product Training](link-to-project)
**Description:** THis was the companys flagship product and what I was brought on board to develop training for this product. In its intial form this curse was a 3 day ILT training mostly at the customer location.

**Technologies Used:** MS PowerPoint,MS WOrd (participany guide) to complement the powerpoint.  

**Highlights:**  In addition to the lecture portion of the course, I built a network lab with 8 ICCAPs that could be accessed remotely from anywhere so the learners could participate in hands on labs and demos. In my previous expirence this was a unique implmentation in that when hands on labs were part of the course the equipment had to be shipped to the lacation. This was 1- Costly and 2- a logistical challenge.
